# sinatra-portfolio-project:
This app allows an Employer to post a list of tasks for a specific employee. That Employee can login to their account to view these tasks and check off the one's they completed.

This application allows for two types of Users:
1. Employer
2. Employee

Employer User can signup/login then create, read, edit, and delete a task.
Employee User can signup/login then read and delete a task. The deleted task will also be deleted when that Employee's Employer logs back in.
